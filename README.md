This is a personal 2D Platformer project. Development is not continuous, but I come back to work on thi sin my spare time.

The core gameplay is that the player can switch between the upper world and the lower world. When the player switches the 
world appears to rotate around the player. Rotation mechanics are completed. Things like obstacles, puzzles, enemies, and 
rewards still need to be added.
